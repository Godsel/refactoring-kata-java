What I wanted to do but time is out :

- add pattern strategy with enum, to simplify business logic for shopping item
- add more tests based on business logic

What would be better from my point of view (with more time ?):

- shopping item as object, to add extension (maybe to add "SWEATSHIRT" later)
- same for customer, if we want to add some later
==> then for each customer, we have a discount, and a max price , and could be even variabilized (ready to get data from database for example, here everything is hard-coded)
+ same goes for shopping item price.



=> a bit frustrated by the outcome
